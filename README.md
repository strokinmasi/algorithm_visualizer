# THE PLAN

This project is a algorithm visualizer for pathfinding algorithms, created to introduce as much customizability to pathfinding algorithms as possible.

## setup

to install all dependancies:

`npm install` in the root directory

to run the server:

`npm start` in the root directory

## extremely rough build plan

1. create the grid base
2. make the grid base size dynamic
3. introduce node states:
    - empty node
    - start node
    - end node
    - wall node
    - more... (later in implementation)
4. introduce the first pathfinding algorithm... Djikstra!!!
