### Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is a web-based pathfinding visualizer built using React and Material-UI. It allows users to interactively visualize the execution of different pathfinding algorithms on a grid. The project includes implementations of Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* algorithms.

## Setup

to install all dependancies:

1. clone and navigate into the repository

`git clone https://github.com/strokinmasi/algorithm_visualizer.git`
`cd pathfinding-visualizer`

2. install dependancies

`npm install`

3. run the server to start the application

`npm start`

4. if application doesn't automatically open, navigate to `http://localhost:[SERVERPORT]` to view application

## Features

- Interactive Grid : Users can click and drag to place start, end, wall nodes and adjust the grid size
- Pathfinding Algorithms : Visualize how DFS, BFS, and A* algorithms find the shortest path between two points on the grid
- Real-Time Updates : See the pathfinding process in real-time with animated transitions

## Technologies Used

- React : JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Material-UI : React component library for building modern web applications
- JavaScript (ES6+) : Core language for implementing the grid logic and pathfinding algorithms
- CSS : Styling for the grid and UI components
